    description: The basic functionality should have been implemented.
                 But I encountered some minor problems in the implementation process,
                 which were finally solved by asking my classmates for advice.
                 For example£ºStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); ...sb.append...;
                 I always had bugs when I used the previous method,
                 but after consulting XiangTeng SiMa , I learned a simpler method without errors.
